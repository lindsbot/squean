{"name":"Squean","tagline":"Sequelize-Express-Angular-Node seed","body":"Welcome to the SQUEAN stack!\r\n\r\n(Sequelize, Express, Angular Node + Passport)\r\n\r\nSquean is a seed that gets you up and running fast with a functioning Node/Angular app with authentication (local strategy only).\r\n\r\nPassport is prebundled and the local (non-OAuth) strategies are setup. Passport has awesome support for virtually any login strategy you need (140+). The maintainer frequently supports the project on Stack Overflow. [Passport.js](http://passportjs.org/)\r\n\r\nThis project was inspired by Linnovate's [MEAN.io](http://www.mean.io/) which is an awesome option if you are using MongoDB with Mongoose. Squean offers a similar jump-off point to get you rolling ASAP with your MySQL-Express-Angular-Node project.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
